# ESC-POS-Print-App
Code lets will generate print from ESC/POS thermal printer

In app.py I have created a server which takes JSON data and send that data to printer.

Data gets print directly there is no preview just direct print.

This kind of application is used when we want to print receipt, we don't need to have a preivew.
